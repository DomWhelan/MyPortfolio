      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <hr />
      <p className="h5">
        From a young age I have had a curiousity of technology. I was the type
        of person who liked to know how everything worked. Although this
        interest was always there I never did persue technology as a career. I
        was also into sports, math, physics and hands on activities. <br /> My
        very first job was on a sod farm and I enjoyed landscaping. This was my
        summer job while I attended high school. After graduating I began to
        search my options of choosing a career path. I heard from some personal
        contacts about the "Welding Engineering Technology" course. The course
        was a great learning experience and upon completion I moved to Alberta
        to start my career in the oil and gas industry. I enjoyed the work and
        decided to persue pipefitting. This is when I moved back home to start
        the apprenticeship. During this time is when I met my wife to be. <br />
        A few years past and it was time to start a family. This is a life
        changer. We both agreed to permanently move back to Newfoundland. This
        is when I started working on fly-in fly-out jobs. After having kids this
        bacame a strain and then the Covid pandemic hit. I thought to
        myself..what is something I have a passion for and I could work in
        Newfoundland. I could not miss any more of my children's lives. Then it
        struck me! Technology! I began looking online for courses being offered
        in colleges nearby. That is when I came across the "Software
        Develpoment" cousre at Keyin College and I knew it was right for me. I
        always loved the atmosphere of Keyin College and I have always had a
        passion for technology.
